working on this challenge has helped in many ways from undersatanding the basic of css workflow and for what this to use when this is just the challenge that can help anyone get started with what they have in there arsenal. Designing this challenge with the help of just the right amount of content hepled me get stared with thinking things that can work with the related target. This challenge was a great start for me.


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<p id="mrp">$169.99</p>
    <hr>
```
```css
#dis-price{
      color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
      display: inline-block;
      font-size:35px;
      padding-bottom: 15px;
    }

    #mrp{
      display: inline-block;
      letter-spacing: normal;
      position: relative;
      padding-top: 20px;
      bottom: 5px;
      left: 5px;
      margin: 0;
      
    }

    hr{
      background-color: hsl(180, 1%, 21%);
      width: 53px;
      display:inline-block;
      position: relative;
      right: 50px;
      bottom:2px;
      border-style:solid;
      border-width: 0.5px;
    }
```
### Continued development

My current work is only limited to desktop devices only. The reason being that i'm not familer with flex or grid designing and currently learning those things. So my next goal is to design pages that can work semlessly for both mobile and desktop devices.

### Useful resources

- [resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me for doubt regarding some Css attributes and options. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.

- [resource 2](Dividing the Css Selectors for easy code Reading) - 
I have read in some articles that a neet code solves many problems this is true by dividing the css part according to there selectors grearly helped me.
